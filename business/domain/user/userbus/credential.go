// A credential in this package is always two parts: an identifier and a
// secret, presented together as "<id>.<secret>".
//
// The split is the whole design and it is worth stating before any of the code
// below.
//
// The identifier is what gets looked up. It is indexed, it is safe to log, and
// finding a row by it costs one indexed read. The secret is never stored --
// only a hash of it is -- and it is compared in constant time. Without the
// split, looking up a credential would mean either storing the secret in a
// searchable form, or scanning every unexpired row and hashing against each,
// which is both slow and a timing oracle for how many rows exist.
//
// It is also what makes a leaked log harmless. Our request logger never
// records a query string, but logs leak by other routes -- a stack trace, a
// proxy, somebody pasting a URL into a chat -- and an identifier on its own
// authorises nothing.

// ErrMalformed is returned when a presented credential is not even the right
// shape. It is deliberately not distinguished from a wrong secret anywhere a
// person can see, because the difference tells whoever is guessing which half
// they got right.
var ErrMalformed = errors.New("not a credential")

// secretHash is a SHA-256 digest of a presented secret.
//
// A plain hash rather than a password KDF, and that is a deliberate choice
// rather than an oversight. bcrypt, scrypt, argon2 and PBKDF2 exist to make
// guessing a *low-entropy human-chosen* secret expensive. Every secret in this
// package is machine-generated with at least 80 bits of entropy from
// crypto/rand, so there is nothing to guess: an attacker holding the hashes
// faces 2^80 or more SHA-256 evaluations per credential, which no iteration
// count meaningfully improves on. Adding a KDF would cost real time on every
// request in exchange for hardening a number that is already out of reach.
//
// crypto/pbkdf2 is in the standard library as of Go 1.24, so this stays a
// choice and not a constraint. If a human-chosen secret is ever introduced
// here -- a password, a PIN -- it must not use this function.
