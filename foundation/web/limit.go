// ClientIP is the visitor's address, as well as this process can know it.
//
// trustProxy has to be configured rather than sniffed. This service listens on
// the loopback behind Apache, so the socket's own address is always 127.0.0.1
// and the visitor's is only in a header -- and a header is exactly as
// trustworthy as whatever is in front of it. Believing one with nothing in
// front lets a stranger choose the bucket their requests are counted in, which
// is worse than having no address at all.
//
// The rightmost X-Forwarded-For entry, not the leftmost. Apache's mod_proxy
// appends the address it saw to whatever header arrived, so every entry but
// the last was written by the client and is whatever they liked; the last is
// the one Apache wrote. (mass-intentions, where this came from, reads the
// leftmost, which lets a client pick a fresh bucket per request by sending
// its own header.) If a second proxy ever stands in front of Apache, the last
// entry becomes that proxy's address and every visitor shares one bucket --
// a limit that refuses too much, which is the side to fail on, and the place
// to change is here.

// eighteen quintillion strangers -- a limit keyed that way is not a limit. IPv4
// is the opposite case, where a whole office can share one address, so it is
// left alone rather than widened further.

// of what is here.

//
// A limiter keyed by something an attacker chooses is a memory leak with a
// rate limit attached. Two things bound it. A bucket that has refilled to full
// is indistinguishable from one that has never been used, so it is deleted;
// that alone bounds the map at however many distinct keys arrive within one
// full refill. And if a flood of distinct keys outruns that, the
// least-recently-seen entries are evicted down to a ceiling -- which does
// weaken the limit for whoever is evicted, and is the right direction: the
// alternative is a process that runs out of memory, which refuses everybody.
